**Summary**
This repository contains Deadly Dodgeball, my submission for the Ubisoft Toronto Next programming challenge, in which contestants had 3 days to create a game in C++ using the provided API and no additional libraries.

The theme for this year's challenge was to create a projectile based game, drawing inspiration from games like Angry Birds and Worms.

Deadly dodgeball is a PvE game that gets increasingly difficult across it's 5 stages. The full instructions and documentation can be found in https://github.com/kierangara/UbisoftNext-2024/blob/master/Deadly_Dodgeball_Documentation.pdf.
